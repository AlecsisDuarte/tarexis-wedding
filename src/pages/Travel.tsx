            <h3>From United States</h3>
            <p>
              The most convenient airport for reaching Valle de Guadalupe from
              San Diego is San Diego International Airport (SAN).
            </p>
            <h4>By Car</h4>
            <p>
              If you choose to fly to San Diego you have a couple of options for
              crossing the border and driving to Valle de Guadalupe.
            </p>
            <h4>By Foot</h4>
            <p>
              From San Diego Airport, you can take a taxi or rideshare
              (Uber/Lyft) to the San Ysidro border crossing. This is often the
              quickest way to cross the border on foot.
            </p>
            <p>Once you've walked across into Tijuana, you can rent a car.</p>
            <p>
              <strong>Travel Tip:</strong> Be prepared for potential wait times
              at the border, especially on weekends or holidays. Check current
              border wait times (link to CBP border wait times website, if
              desired). Ensure you have your valid passport ready!
            </p>
            <h4>By Car</h4>
            <p>
              You can drive any car over the border (rental or your own).
              However, if you have Global Entry, you can pre-register your car
              and join a faster line to cross.

            <h3>From Mexico</h3>
            <p>

              Once you've crossed into Tijuana, you'll navigate through the city
